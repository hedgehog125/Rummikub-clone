Sounds really make games come alive. <br>
GameLib makes it easy to add sounds to your game. <br>
Here are the sound commands: <br>
<textarea rows="4" cols="100">
play(Path to audio file, Starting pos (secs), Loop (true/false), Restart delay (secs), Restart pos (secs)) // Play a file.
stop(ID) // Stop a file.
pause(ID) // Pause a file.
resume(ID) // Resume a file.
</textarea><br>
All of them except the first one need an id which is the amount of sounds playing when it was added. <br>
Note: if a sound finishes and there is still another file playing the id will not go down. <br>
e.g:
Background music is playing. It's ID: 0 <br>
A sound effect plays. It's ID: 1 <br>
Another sound effect plays. It's ID: 2 <br>
<br>
Ids will only go back down if there are no active sounds, or if they are the most recent sound started. (Paused sounds will also count.) <br>
The first command might seem complicated, so here's a simple one: <br>
<textarea rows="1" cols="50">
play(Path to audio file,0,false,0,0) // Play a file.
</textarea><br><br>
That's a non loop one. <br>
Here's a loop one: <br>
<textarea rows="1" cols="50">
play(Path to audio file,0,true,10,0) // Play a file.
</textarea><br><br>
Now you can control have sound! :D <br>
